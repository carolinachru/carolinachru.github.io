I am currently a <b>Ph.D. student in Computer Science</b> at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder), with a primary focus on Computational Social Science.

Broadly, my research aims to understand <b>how social and gender inequality influences the production, creation, and dissemination of knowledge, with a specific emphasis on the scientific ecosystem. Methodologically, I am passionate about leveraging computational science for social science research. 

Prior to embarking on my Ph.D. journey in the fall of 2023, I completed a master's program in <b>Applied Social Data Science</b> at the London School of Economics (LSE) with Distinction and obtained a bachelor's degree in <b>Economics</b> from the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM).

In my professional experience, I have contributed to multidimensional poverty measurements in Mexico during my time at Mexico's National Council for Evaluation of Social Policy; contributed to research on technology and gender at the Oxford Internet Institute and engaged in social statistics work for the data-startup HACE.
