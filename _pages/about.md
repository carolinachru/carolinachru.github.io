I'm a <b>Ph.D. student in Computer Science</b> at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder), with a primary focus on Computational Social Science. I'm also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Women & Gender Studies. My advisors are [Aaron Clauset](https://aaronclauset.github.io/) and [Daniel Acuña](https://acuna.io/).


<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Broadly, my research aims to understand <b>how social and gender inequality influences the production, creation, and dissemination of knowledge</b>, with a specific emphasis on the scientific ecosystem. Methodologically, I am passionate about leveraging computational science for social science research. </p>

Prior to starting my Ph.D. in the fall of 2023, I completed a master's program in <b>Applied Social Data Science</b> at the London School of Economics (LSE) with Distinction and obtained a bachelor's degree in <b>Economics</b> from the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM). In my professional experience, I have contributed to multidimensional poverty measurements in Mexico during my time at Mexico's [National Council for Evaluation of Social Policy](https://www.coneval.org.mx/Paginas/principal.aspx); contributed to research on technology and gender at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/); and engaged in social statistics work for the data-startup [HACE](https://www.thisishace.com/).
