I'm a first-year <b>PhD student in Computer Science</b> at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU Boulder), with a primary focus on Computational Social Science and Science of Science. I'm also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Women and Gender Studies. My advisors are [Aaron Clauset](https://aaronclauset.github.io/) and [Daniel Acu√±a](https://acuna.io/).



Broadly, my research aims to understand <b>how social and gender inequality influences the production, creation, and dissemination of knowledge</b>, with an emphasis on the scientific ecosystem. Methodologically, I am passionate about leveraging computational science for social science research.



Prior to starting my PhD, I completed a MSc in <b>Applied Social Data Science</b> at the London School of Economics (LSE) with Distinction and obtained a BA in <b>Economics</b> from the Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM). In my professional experience, I have contributed to multidimensional poverty measurements in Mexico during my time at its [National Council for Evaluation of Social Policy](https://www.coneval.org.mx/Paginas/principal.aspx); contributed to research on technology and gender at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/); and engaged in social statistics work for the data-startup [HACE](https://www.thisishace.com/).
